# Code test Grebban
### Assignment
Create a classic tile sliding puzzle game. It needs to fulfill some requirements, like having a responsive design for any screen size, a button to reset the game, and some way to notify the player when they solve the puzzle. 

Another criteria that needs to be fulfilled is the possibility to change the number of rows and columns in the code. You will find instructions for how to do that in this repo below.

## How to get started
1. Clone the repo to your local environment.
2. Open a terminal and make sure to be in the `codetest-grebban` directory. If you already have a terminal open, navigate to the correct directory.
3. Run `npm start` in the terminal to start the app in development mode.
4. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.


## How to change the number of rows and columns
1. Locate and open the `config.js` file in `kodtest-grebban/src/`.
2. Change the rows and columns variables to desired amount and save file.
3. Navigate back to browser and refresh the page.
